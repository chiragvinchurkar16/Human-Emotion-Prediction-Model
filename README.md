# Human-Emotion-Prediction-Model

This project involved building a machine learning model to classify emotions into two categories: negative emotions (sadness, anger, fear) and positive emotions (joy, love, surprise). The goal was to accurately predict the emotional sentiment of the data based on given inputs.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a seamless process for predicting human emotion by building a machine learning model that analyzes various emotions parameters.
